## About 
Hi, I'm Sheik Shameem! I am a Masterâ€™s in management graduate from Nyenrode Business University, specializing in Digital Business and Innovation. My journey has been shaped by diverse experiences across two continents. I have developed a strong foundation in management studies and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights.

I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques in my free time, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
