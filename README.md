# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

## About 
Hi, I'm **Sheik Shameem**! I am a **Masterâ€™s in management graduate** from Nyenrode Business University, specializing in Digital Business and Innovation. My journey has been shaped by diverse experiences across two continents. I have developed a strong foundation in management studies and a passion for data analytics to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data and analytics as an **entry-level analyst**.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management and statistical analysis, which will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques in my free time, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

My CV is in ().

This repository showcases skills, shares projects and tracks my progress in Data analytics-related topics.
