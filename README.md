## About 
Hi, I'm Sheik Shameem! I am a Masterâ€™s in management graduate from Nyenrode Business University, specializing in Digital Business and Innovation. My journey has been shaped by diverse experiences across two continents. I have developed a strong foundation in management studies and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management and statistical analysis, which will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques in my free time, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

My CV is in ().
